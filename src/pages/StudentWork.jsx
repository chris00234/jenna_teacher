        <h2>üåé Earth Day & Poetry Month: Integrated ELA with Author‚Äôs Craft</h2>
        <p>To celebrate both Earth Day and National Poetry Month, I designed and implemented an integrated ELA unit that combined environmental awareness with poetic expression. This cross-curricular project offered students a meaningful opportunity to engage with literature while reflecting on their relationship with the planet.
           <br /><br />
            Throughout the unit, I introduced students to key author‚Äôs craft tools such as alliteration, rhyme, imagery, and personification. Students learned to identify these elements in mentor texts and were then guided to apply them creatively in their own Earth-themed poems. These lessons not only supported writing development but also encouraged critical thinking and an appreciation for language.
            <br /><br />
            To meet the needs of all learners, I developed customized worksheets tailored for each grade level from Kindergarten to 3rd grade. Each worksheet was designed to align with grade-appropriate standards and provide engaging, scaffolded activities that supported both reading comprehension and original poetry writing.
            <br /><br />
            The student samples presented here showcase their ability to thoughtfully apply poetic techniques while expressing their care and concern for the environment.</p>

        <h2>üåé Art & ELA Writing Integration: How We Can Help the Earth Art & ELA Writing Integration: How We Can Help the Earth</h2>
        <p>As part of our Earth Day celebrations, I integrated visual art and writing to create a meaningful, student-centered project that encouraged both creative expression and environmental awareness. In this activity, students were invited to think critically about their role in caring for the planet and to express their ideas both through words and illustrations.
            <br /><br />
            Students brainstormed and wrote four ways they could help save the Earth, using age-appropriate writing strategies. After completing their writing, they created drawings to visually represent each action, making powerful connections between language, art, and real-world responsibility.
            <br /><br />
            This project allowed students to practice informative writing, while also engaging in reflective thinking and personal accountability. By combining writing with drawing, all learners‚Äîespecially visual and emerging writers‚Äîwere able to express themselves meaningfully.
            <br /><br />
            The student work featured here demonstrates not only their growing writing skills, but also their creativity, compassion, and commitment to taking care of our Earth.</p>

            <p>This student work sample is part of the 'Rescue Plan Poster Project,' which I created as an engaging extension activity for the text 'Kids to the Rescue,' from the McGraw Hill Wonders curriculum. I designed the worksheet and project guidelines to encourage students to synthesize their understanding of the text while fostering creativity and critical thinking.
                <br /><br />    
                The project required students to imagine a rescue scenario, outline a plan, and present their ideas visually on a poster. This activity aligned with key comprehension objectives, including identifying and analyzing main ideas and supporting details, while also integrating writing and artistic expression. The worksheet I developed provided structured prompts to guide students in organizing their thoughts and translating them into a clear and creative presentation. These student samples showcase their ability to apply their learning in a meaningful and imaginative way, reflecting the effectiveness of this project in reinforcing comprehension and engagement.
